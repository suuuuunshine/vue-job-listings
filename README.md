📌 Approach
Project Structure
The project follows a modular architecture with reusable components:

bash

src/
│── components/   # UI components (JobCard.vue, JobList.vue, etc.)
│── views/        # Page views (JobList.vue, JobDetail.vue)
│── store/       # Pinia store for state management
│── router/       # Vue Router configuration
│── assets/       # Static assets (CSS, images)
│── tests/        # Unit tests using Vitest
│── main.ts       # App entry point
│── App.vue       # Root component
State Management
Used Pinia to manage job listings and filters efficiently.

Routing
Used Vue Router with two main routes:

/jobs → Displays job listings.

/jobs/:id → Shows job details.

Testing
Used Vitest for unit tests to ensure component correctness.
